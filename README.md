# Forest Fairy Gemstone Game

**Forest Fairy Gemstone Game** is a whimsical browser-based game where you guide forest fairies to collect magical gemstones to sustain their lifespan. As each fairy wanders through the enchanted forest, you must collect gemstones to keep them alive and summon new companions.

## Features

* **Adjustable Lifespan**: Use the slider to set how long each fairy lives (1–60 minutes).
* **Dynamic Fairy Behavior**: Fairies idle with a gentle bounce, then wander in random directions, bouncing off screen edges.
* **Gemstone Collection & Scoring**: Collect gems to earn points and spawn additional fairies—more fairies, more fun!
* **Visual Alerts**: Fairies change color based on remaining lifespan:

  * Orange at half-life
  * Red when low on life
* **Interactive Gameplay**:

  * Drag fairies around with touch or pointer input.
  * Click reset to restart the adventure.
* **Sound Effects**: Plop and bling sounds enhance the magical experience.
* **Pop Disappearance Animation**: Fairies expand briefly before vanishing at end of lifespan.

## Gameplay

1. **Set Lifespan**: Adjust the slider in the top-left corner to choose how long fairies live.
2. **Collect Gems**: Click or drag fairies to guide them over gemstones—each collected gemstone adds to your score.
3. **Spawn Fairies**: Every 100 gems (or fewer in testing mode), a new fairy joins the forest.
4. **Monitor Fairies**: Watch their color:

   * Green: Plenty of life
   * Orange: Half-life reached
   * Red: Running out of time
5. **Survival**: Keep at least one fairy alive; if all fairies expire, the game ends.
